# AI-ML-Projects
This is my repo of ai ml projects. Till now it consists of two projects, but soon more projects will be uploaded as well . 
About these Projects
These two projects are:
1. An open Ai assistant jarvis program : This program is completely created by me with scratch and it is going with modifications from my first year. This program is for laptop automation, that is your voice commands will be interpreted by it and then as per the command actions will be carried out. That means if you ask it to set alarm , to open hotspot, to open google , to search wikipidea, to play music, to make a call , to send message , whatsapp message and many more.  Just chk it out , really it is not optimized but i have made it from scratch and will be optimized further also.
2. A face recognition program --> which will mark the attendance of the student once a student will be detected through face recognization module, and will check the best possible similarity in the database.

                                 !! WAIT FOR MORE!!
